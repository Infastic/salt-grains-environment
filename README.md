# salt-grains-envrionment

My solution to managing what environment my computers are in.

The folder structure here mimics how the file should sit in the [file_root](http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/file_server/file_roots.html).  For example, the __grains_ folder is same __grains_ folder referenced in the [grains doc](http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/file_server/file_roots.html).
